    <img src="../images/kabab.jpg" alt="kabab image">
    <p>Any party is incomplete without some delicious appetizers to kick start with and there would 
        be no better option than some hot, grilled or roasted seekh kebabs. Kebabs made from minced
        mutton and chicken meat, slathered in a bowl of spices and grilled to perfection. Full of 
        juice and flavor, these kebabs are perfect as a starter for an amazing dinner party. Served 
        with mint chutney and a side of onion rings and lemon wedges, you won't need anything else
        to start the party!
